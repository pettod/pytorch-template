# Pytorch Template

## Introduction

Template to start developing models in Pytorch. What does the template do:

- Run training for a dataset (training and validation datasets)
- Print metrics after each iteration
- "Early stopping" callback to stop training when not progressing anymore
- Save one model or multiple models weights, optimizer(s) state, scheduler(s) state
- Save log file (.csv) of loss and metrics for train and validation data after each epoch
- Save learning curves image (.png) of loss and metrics after each epoch
- Save test images after each epoch (image-to-image tasks)
- Save all data to Tensorboard
- Easily use GAN (generative adversarial network)
- Load pretrained weights, optimizer state and scheduler state from file (also for discriminator)
- Train multiple models at the same time

## Usage

Things needed to be changed in a new project:

1. `config.py`: Change configurations of the training such as hyperparameters, data paths, loss function, optimizer, scheduler etc. Most of the work of iterating different data, architectures, augmentations, losses etc. happens through this file.

1. `src/dataset.py`: Define [PyTorch dataset](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/data_loading_tutorial.html) which returns single sample with given sample index. Inherit `Dataset`, and implement `__len__` and `__getitem__` member functions.

1. `src/trainer.py`: If your data is more complex, implement `trainIteration` and `validationIteration` member functions.

1. `src/loss_functions.py`: Define your loss functions.

1. `src/metrics.py`: Create metric functions that take only 2 inputs (prediction and ground truth). These functions are used automatically in the code.

1. `src/architectures/`: Add model structure to this folder and import from there.

1. `test.py`: Modify tests depending on your prediction data type.

## Installation

You can define updated versions of the libraries for the project. Here in the example, no versions has been defined.

```bash
conda install pytorch torchvision
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run Training

```bash
python train.py
```
